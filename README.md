In this project, I learned how to effectively predict employee attrition using various data analysis techniques and libraries. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

I utilized the following libraries and tools:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, allowing me to create insightful plots such as count plots and histograms to understand the distribution of attrition and other categorical variables.
Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, to predict employee attrition based on various features.

The techniques I applied included:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.
One-Hot Encoding: Transforming categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a thorough analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, which helped in feature selection.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the performance of the predictive models.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of employee dynamics within organizations.
